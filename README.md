# Wines-and-Flowers-

Problem Statement

Wines and flowers have been around for thousands of years, and people have been free to go to their nearest stores to buy them and gift them to their loved ones. However, that is the past now. Due to the pandemic, many people have not been able to confidently go outside and shop for their favorite people. To ensure that these clients are satisfied, developing a wine and flower delivery website is important. 

Solution

Create an online application/platform that allows users to order a variety of wines and flower types with a same-day delivery option to the address of their loved ones at work, home, school, or hospital in the comfort of their homes or any place at a cheaper price.
